# Guardians of the Flame: Fiery Conflict
Text Adventure Game

Setting: The game takes place in a contemporary world where cities and towns function similarly to ours, but with one significant difference: dragons exist.

Recently, dragon attacks have become more frequent and intense, suggesting ominous motives behind their actions. The Fire Wing Brigade has recruited the player, a new but promising firefighter, to help confront this threat. As the game progresses, players learn that the dragons are being incited by a mysterious force known only as the "Ember Lord," rumored to be a legendary dragon who has lived for centuries hidden in the volcanic mountains surrounding Pyroclast. The player's mission is to traverse various fire-ravaged environments, rescue civilians, and ultimately discover and confront the Ember Lord to stop the chaos.
